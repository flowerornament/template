{"id":"template-ukt","title":"Simplify template structure - cut ~40 files","description":"## Motivation\n\nThe template has grown to ~55 files, which is too complex. Coding agents tend to over-engineer, and this template is a prime example. The goal should be: an agent reads INIT.md + a few snippets and can set up any project. Everything else adds cognitive load without proportional value.\n\n## What to Cut\n\n| Directory | Reason to cut |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| `examples/` (3 dirs) | Duplicates snippets. Agents can assemble from snippets directly. |\n| `patterns/` (5 files) | Teaches agents how to write instructions - they already know this. |\n| `gsd-planning/` (8 files) | GSD itself creates these via /gsd:new-project. Redundant with the tool. |\n| `snippets/claude-code/settings/` (3 files) | Minimal value. Agents figure out settings.json on their own. |\n| `snippets/git-commands/` (3 files) | Redundant with claude-code/commands/. Keep one, not both. |\n\n## Proposed Pruned Structure (~15 files)\n\n```\ntemplate/\n├── AGENTS.md                    # Meta documentation (update to reflect simpler structure)\n├── INIT.md                      # Main guide (simplify to match)\n├── RESEARCH.md                  # Keep - useful context\n├── questions/\n│   └── init-questions.md        # Keep - the question flow\n└── snippets/\n    ├── claude-md/               # Keep all 5 variants\n    │   ├── minimal.md\n    │   ├── beads.md\n    │   ├── gsd.md\n    │   ├── research.md\n    │   └── automate.md\n    ├── agents-md/\n    │   └── full.md              # Keep\n    ├── ai-directory/            # Keep all\n    │   ├── architecture.md\n    │   ├── conventions.md\n    │   ├── research/\n    │   │   ├── questions.md\n    │   │   ├── findings.md\n    │   │   └── sources.md\n    │   └── automation/\n    │       ├── schedule.md\n    │       ├── triggers.md\n    │       └── outputs.md\n    └── claude-code/\n        ├── commands/            # Keep all 6\n        │   ├── commit.md\n        │   ├── pr.md\n        │   ├── release.md\n        │   ├── status.md\n        │   ├── wip.md\n        │   └── sync.md\n        ├── hooks.md             # Keep\n        └── skills/\n            └── smart-commit/    # Keep - actually useful\n                ├── SKILL.md\n                └── .claude-pr-policy.json\n```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Delete directories: examples/, snippets/patterns/, snippets/gsd-planning/, snippets/claude-code/settings/, snippets/git-commands/\n2. Update AGENTS.md to reflect simpler structure\n3. Update INIT.md - remove references to deleted content, simplify where possible\n4. Verify remaining snippets still work with INIT.md flow\n5. Commit with message explaining the simplification rationale\n\n## Key Principle\n\nIf GSD or beads or the agent itself creates something, don't template it. Only template what the agent genuinely needs to copy.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-10T17:00:35.667082-08:00","created_by":"morgan","updated_at":"2026-01-10T17:00:56.79295-08:00"}
