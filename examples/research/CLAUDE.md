# Research: [Topic]

> Investigation into [subject area].

## Research Questions

1. [Primary question to answer]
2. [Secondary question]
3. [Additional question]

## Current Focus

[What aspect is being investigated now]

## Approach

1. Gather sources and references
2. Document findings as discovered
3. Synthesize insights
4. Identify gaps and next questions

## Structure

```
.ai/research/
├── questions.md    # Active research questions
├── findings.md     # Documented discoveries
└── sources.md      # References and citations
```

## Workflow

### Adding Findings
1. Document in `findings.md` with source
2. Update `sources.md` with reference
3. Mark questions as answered in `questions.md`
4. Add follow-up questions as they arise

### Tracking Progress
- Use beads for research tasks
- `bd ready` - see what to investigate next
- `bd close <id>` - when question is answered

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `bd ready` | Available research tasks |
| `bd create` | New research question |
| `bd close` | Mark question answered |

## Context

This is a research-only project focused on investigation and documentation.
No code output is expected unless explicitly requested.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Summary of findings
- [ ] Key insights
- [ ] Open questions for future research
- [ ] Source bibliography
