## Project Knowledge

When you learn something significant about this project, document it in `.ai/`:
- `architecture.md` - System structure, component relationships, data flow
- `decisions.md` - Key choices and rationale
- `learnings.md` - Discoveries, gotchas, patterns

Create these files when there's real content, not before. Update them as the project evolves.

## Notes

Project-specific conventions or gotchas.
